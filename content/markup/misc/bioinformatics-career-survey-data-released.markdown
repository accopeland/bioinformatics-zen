<p>The title says it all. I was hoping to release this a month ago, but standardising the survey data was a bigger effort than I anticipated. Finally though, you can <a href="http://github.com/michaelbarton/bioinformatics-career-survey/tree/master%2Fdata%2Fsurvey.csv?raw=true">download the results in CSV format from Github</a>. If you don&#8217;t know what CSV format is, don&#8217;t worry as the file should open in Excel, OpenOffice.org, or any spread sheet application you care to point at it. The only other thing you need to know is this data is released under a Creative Commons Attribution, Share-a-like, Non-commercial license, if you need to know what this licensing means <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">you can read the full explanation</a>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it in a nutshell, the details about sharing and posting results can be found on <a href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/Biogang:Projects/Bioinformatics_Career_Survey_2008">Open Wet Ware</a>, including <a href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/Biogang:Projects/Bioinformatics_Career_Survey_2008_Results">some example analyses I&#8217;ve posted</a>.</p>
