Heard about how the internet is revolutionising science and bioinformatics? The semantic web is giving meaning to your data, life, as well as writing grant proposals for you? Well, not quite. The party may just be getting started, but there are already some great sites for taking advantage of the web science buzz.

The <a href="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:ybfaNkWeoDEJ:www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ELI7001.pdf">social bookmarking</a> site <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> is excellent for managing your own bookmarks, and searching those of others. Here's a tutorial using delicious to find links on topics you're interested in.

Here's the del.icio.us frontpage.

I'm interested in a bioinformatics topic, such as multiple sequence alignment. So I enter this in the search box in the top right corner. Highlighted by the red circle.
<img src="http://www.bioinformaticszen.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/delicious_search_box.jpg" id="image9" alt="delicious search box" />

This returns a list of web pages that delicious users have tagged in relation to this topic. Each entry gives a link to the result, and a link to save the page to your own delicious bookmarks. Beneath each result are the keywords that the user has used to describe the site. Finally there is link to the other delicious users who have this bookmark in their collection.
I'm interested in the tool MUSCLE (red box), but I'd also like to see what else people are interested in. I click on "saved by 10 people" (green box) to jump to this.

This page summarises the delicious links for the MUSCLE tool. On the upper right (red box), is summarised the words that all the users have tagged the link with. As you might expect, bioinformatics is the most commonly used word.  Clicking on this will take us to other pages tagged with bioinformatics.
Below this (green box), are the users who have bookmarked the MUSCLE tool. Clicking on one of the users' names will take me to their delicious page.

This user's page shows a list of the links in their collection. I refine this to topics I am interested in by clicking on one of the tags (red and green boxes). Here, I have selected the pages marked with "sequence alignment". This then gives me a set of links related to the topic I am interested in, as seen in the list.
