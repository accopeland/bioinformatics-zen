Another great week for the survey, where the total number of entries now exceeds 600. Thank you to everyone who has filled in the survey,  or posted a link on their website.  Special thanks this week to everyone on friendfeed <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/c46baa5e-43a0-3be1-d791-1c2465d2bcf5/Bioinformatics-Career-Survey-Second-Week/">who volunteered to forward the survey on a bioinformatics related mailing list</a>, and to <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/fbd6b620-6fae-4742-9ce3-73a1a0a5749e/Science-blogging-and-Web-2-0-BoF-in-room-718B-on/">everyone who spread the word at ISMB</a>. This is the last week of July so on Friday, I'm going to press the stop button, and release the dataset for everyone interested to start producing lovely plots and graphs.

As for current status of the results you can see France has leaped up to second place in the number of entries received, which may be something to do with <a href="http://plindenbaum.blogspot.com/">Pierre</a> forwarding the survey onto a French Bioinformatics mailing list. Furthermore Switzerland is a surprise new entry at number 9, edging Italy out the top 10.

As for geographic disribution of results, the map shows there is now at least one entry from a large proportion of the world. Specific new entries this week were from China, Russia, Finland, Jordan, and Cambodia. I think it would be great to have more entries from Africa before the end, as the continent is only represented by two countries: Kenya and South Africa.

There are five days left, and I think it would be great to have 800 entries before the end. If you're reading this blog, I would guess that you've probably already filled in the form, so instead of asking you again to fill in the form, I'm asking if any one has any suggestions for a final burst of publicity. The survey has already been forwarded on to a variety of bioinformatics mailing lists, but if you know of one that hasn't been contacted and you think that may be interested, that would great if you could send an email about the survey. Any other suggestions for publicity are welcome too.
