Neil Saunders has posted a <a href="http://nsaunders.wordpress.com/2007/05/05/moving-from-the-desktop-to-the-web/">great tip</a> on using the new <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">iGoogle</a> page to synchronise your internet paraphernalia across computers. I definitely agree with his points. Having to "mark as read" the blog posts you read at home, in your work RSS reader, is a bit of a pain. Online tools, as opposed to installed, are where things are going, and iGoogle is an example of this.

One cool thing that google also offers is a <a href="http://www.google.com/psearch">new personalised search</a>. Search results tailored to what you're interested in, based on previous searches. Does this work with google scholar? It would be cool if you could upload your bibliographic database to google and it weighted your searches based on your article interests.
