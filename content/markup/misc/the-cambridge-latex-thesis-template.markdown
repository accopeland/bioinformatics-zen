If you've ever used LaTeX you'll probably agree with me when I say that it makes writing documents much easier. A lot of the problems encountered using WYSIWYG editors, images jumping around, or manually numbering figures, just don't exist.

Writing a thesis or dissertation, however, usually some extra features that aren't included in the standard LaTeX report template. A rather specific layout to the front page for example. Fortunately <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Users/aje/">Anton Enright</a>, has made a Cambridge thesis template available on his website. The tar ball also comes with a build file, and Perl scripts to add papers to your literature database. I say definitely worth a look when it comes to writing up time.
