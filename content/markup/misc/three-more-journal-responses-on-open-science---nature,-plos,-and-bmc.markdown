All emails have been put on the Nodalpoint <a href="http://wiki.nodalpoint.org/journal_personal_website_publication_policies">wiki</a>. Here's a brief summary of each.

Nature's response came from the always helpful Maxine Clarke, who regularly appears on their <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/nautilus/">publishing blog</a>. Nature encourages the discussion of work by scientists prior to publication, such as the established practices of preprint servers and presenting at conferences, but blogs and wikis are also covered under this. Nature is however very strict about discussing work with the media until the peer review process is complete.

I contacted Matt Hodgkinson at BMC, after reading about <a href="http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2007/07/24/conversation-with-bmc-on-open-notebook-science/">a discussion with Heather</a> on her blog. Publishing data and figures on personal websites is considered by BMC to be similar to informal preprint circulation, and therefore does not prevent the inclusion of the data in an article submitted to the journal. Matt <a href="http://journalology.blogspot.com/">also has a blog</a> where he discusses issues related to journals and publishing.

Matt Patterson replied regarding PLoS's attitude to open notebook science. Currently PLoS have no clear policy, but they've had several enquiries so plan to review their stance with regards to this. Matt kindly said he would send me a follow up email when this was clearer
<h4>Bio::Blogs special edition</h4>
I'm still aiming to get this special edition finished in time for the August 1 edition of Bio::Blogs. The response from the journals has been good, and we've got four in total. I'm hoping to get a few more in future, but I think we need to keep the momentum going, so I'm going start lobbying for people interested in open science to contribute an opinion piece. So if you've got an opinion on open notebook science, you could, if you're feeling generous, write a short piece of text then email me or post it on the Nodalpoint wiki <a href="http://wiki.nodalpoint.org/open_science_opinions">page</a>.
