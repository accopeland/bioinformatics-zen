As you are reading this, the number of entries for the bioinformatics career survey should have just reached 400. With two weeks passed, and two more weeks to go, the survey is halfway through. If you haven't already filled it in, <a href="http://www.bioinformaticszen.com/2008/07/creating-a-picture-of-different-careers-in-bioinformatics/">please try and take a few minutes to do so</a>, you can leave any fields blank that you're uncomfortable with.

As for the results, in the second week USA and Spain are still first and second place respectively. The UK has moved up to third to overtake Germany in fourth. Possibly related to a link on the <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/indigenus/2008/07/bioinformatics_survey.html">Nature India Blog</a> India has taken fifth place, with Australia now in sixth. The remaining positions remain the same as the previous week. There is only a two point difference between the UK in third, and India in fifth, while only four entries between France in seventh and Italy in tenth, so a few more results from any of these countries can easily change the order.

I used <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/">IBM's Many Eyes website</a> to visualise the results by region, as it allows you to interact by zooming in, and roll over countries with the mouse to get results . From the map the results are mainly centred on North America, Europe, and the India/Australasia regions, but it's interesting to see a couple of entries from Kenya and South Africa, as well as Columbia, Brazil, Chile and Argentina in South America.
