I said, <a href="http://www.bioinformaticszen.com/2007/08/two-journal-replies/">a month ago</a>, that there would be an <a href="http://drexel-coas-elearning.blogspot.com/2006/09/open-notebook-science.html">open science</a> section for <a href="http://my.biotechlife.net/2007/09/01/bioblogs-14-the-lightning-edition/">this month's issue</a> of Bio::Blogs. Unfortunately this wasn't the case. There are a number of theories as to why this didn't materialise, including global warming, the recent stock market panic, or the appointment of new British Prime Minister. However research has suggested that it was because I didn't work on it; though the other reasons are linked to having had secondary effects.

I'm still very keen on the open notebook science movement: <a href="http://www.bioinformaticszen.com/2007/06/the-case-for-open-science/">I think open collaboration will benefit everyone involved</a>. So, when I should have been working on the Bio::Blogs special edition, I was instead tinkering with my small 80MB-of-RAM server, so that it could serve up two blogs without bursting into flame. Something rather tricky since just handling bioinformaticszen.com was becoming increasingly laboured. However after switching from apache to <a href="http://photomatt.net/2005/05/11/wp-cache/">lighttpd with wp-cache</a>, it's now successfully running two blogs rather quickly.

"Two blogs?" I hear you cry. "Well that's just self aggrandisement gone mad. What you write on one website is barely enough to keep me interested, let alone two."

These are both valid points, though I am hurt to hear you say such things. In my defence the second blog is not about such trivialities as what cereal I ate for breakfast (I prefer toast), but rather my open science notebook. Anyone who is interested in reading about my research on how the atomic composition, or biosynthetic cost of a protein affects its expression can go to <a href="http://www.michaelbarton.me.uk/">www.michaelbarton.me.uk</a>. Even better (for me), they might be feeling generous enough to start a discussion in the comments.

What effect this shameless publicity will have, only time will tell, and I will be sure as to write here to let you know. As for the next Bio::Blogs special edition, I will try to work a little bit each week on it. How does before Christmas sound?
