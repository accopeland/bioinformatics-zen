A <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2007/03/signaltonoise_r.html">post</a> at Presentation Zen discusses keeping the signal-to-noise ratio in presentations as low as possible. Definitely worth a look, the point is to keep your slides uncluttered (noise) so that the audience can focus on your message (signal).

As an example of this I recently gave a presentation to illustrate <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/103/7/2166">hierarchical regulation</a>. I gave the talk to a non bioinformatics audience so therefore I was trying to present using a simple and straight forward manner. The slides included a couple of graphs, and since I've mentioned graphs in presentations <a href="http://www.bioinformaticszen.com/2007/02/the-right-graph-at-the-right-time/">previously</a> I thought I'd include a few slides here. The presentation might appear minimal, but I was also speaking at the same time.
