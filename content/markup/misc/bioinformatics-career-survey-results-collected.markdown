July is over, and therefore so is the period for collecting results for this career survey. In total there are 681 entries. The top ten list of countries for results is shown in the graph below. The most entries were received from the USA, almost double of those received from France in second place.

World wide, the survey received entries from 52 different countries, which last week included Uganda, Nigeria, Zambia, Tanzania, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. The distribution of countries in the survey is shown in the map below.

Finally I organised the results by macro-regions which, as you might expect, illustrated that the majority of entries came from North America and Europe.

<strong>Releasing the data</strong>

The next step is to release the data under a creative commons license, so that anyone who wants to, can analyse it. However, at the moment I'm just going through the data to tidy it up, such as converting converting figures like $30k to 30000 so that the results are standardised, and programmatically readable.

I had been thinking about a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">creative commons share-alike</a> license, so that any derivative results are also released in the public domain. I had also thought to host the data, as well as create a page for collaboration on <a href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/Main_Page">Open Wet Ware</a>. All suggestions towards this are really, really welcome though, as the plan for this isn't fixed, and there is a large element of working things out as they go on.
