This is the February edition of <a href="http://bioblogs.wordpress.com/">Bio::Blogs</a>, an aggregation of bioinformatics posts from the past month. This issue has a particular focus on <a href="http://drexel-coas-elearning.blogspot.com/2006/09/open-notebook-science.html">Open Notebook Science</a> - researchers sharing their work as they produce it.

For this edition, with the help of <a href="http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/">Cameron Neylon</a>, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/09157209601339686455">Jean-Claude Bradley</a>, and <a href="http://pbeltrao.blogspot.com/">Pedro Beltrao</a>, I've tried to write a short essay on open science as well as the open notebook variety. <a href="http://www.michaelbarton.me.uk/2008/02/a-short-essay-on-open-notebook-science/">I've posted this on my research website</a>.

Cameron Neylon's proposal for an ONS Network <a href="http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2008/02/01/open-network-proposal-referees-comments-are-in/">has received comments from the reviewers</a>, and I think this is great for moving ONS to formal acceptance by the wider community. <a href="http://onebiglab.blogspot.com/">Shirley Wu and friends</a> have burst onto the scene with multiple blog posts on ONS, and the rapid development of an <a href="http://onebiglab.blogspot.com/2008/01/call-for-letters-of-support-for-psb.html">ONS session proposal for the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing</a>, and again is something that will gain ONS recognition. As to why openness is important for research, Cameron has a further post comparing <a href="http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2008/01/27/picture-this/">two scenarios of open and closed science</a>.

The biggest event in the calendar this January was the <a href="http://scienceblogging.com/">Science Blogging Conference</a> in North Carolina, where there was a session on publicly available scientific data. Jean Claude Bradley co-chaired the event and <a href="http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/2008/01/back-from-science-bloging-2008.html">provides links to the videos on his blog</a>. Deepak also <a href="http://mndoci.com/blog/2008/01/21/the-future-of-scientific-publishing/">discussed some of his SB08 thoughts</a>. Frank Gibson has stated his intention to <a href="http://peanutbutter.wordpress.com/2008/01/28/standard-opened-up-science/">post the data from his PhD online</a>, conforming to MIAPE standards. The <a href="http://mndoci.com/blog/2008/01/03/the-importance-of-data-portability-microformats-and-distribution/">topic of standards and their role in a culture of data sharing</a> was discussed by Deepak, where the web should move from a simple repository of data, to a platform that enables easy sharing of interconnected datasets. This is parallel to Duncan's point about the <a href="http://www.nodalpoint.org/2008/01/18/one_thousand_databases_high_and_rising">explosion of databases in bioinformatics</a>. Finally, an important issue in sharing your data prior to publication, there was a large debate your research being scooped. There is a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/01/whos_scooping_whom_and_why_thi.php">round up of this</a> on A Blog around the Clock, and gets a further mention on <a href="http://onebiglab.blogspot.com/2008/01/scooping-debate-continues.html">One Big Lab</a>.

So that's the open science part done, but there were plenty of other things going on in the bioinformatics blog community. Neil Saunders <a href="http://nsaunders.wordpress.com/2008/01/31/gene-wiki/">mentioned the Gene Wiki project</a>, the aim to give every human gene a page on Wikipedia, some kind of online encyclopedia. He also gave an <a href="http://nsaunders.wordpress.com/2008/01/25/a-birthday-of-sorts/">interesting perspective on the history of nodalpoint.org</a>, the original bioinformatics blog. Researcherid.com, a site to give every researcher a unique id, received attention from <a href="http://plindenbaum.blogspot.com/2008/01/thomson-scientific-launches.html">Pierre</a>, <a href="http://nsaunders.wordpress.com/2008/01/17/researcher-id/">Neil</a>, and <a href="http://mndoci.com/blog/2008/01/17/researcherid-doesnt-seem-like-all-that/">Deepak</a>. A recent paper on the uncertainty in aligning sequences took the interest of <a href="http://blindscientist.genedrift.org/2008/01/30/things-you-can-only-learn-from-science-the-journal-not-science-itself/">Blind.Scientist</a>, <a href="http://wrightfisher.wordpress.com/2008/01/25/20/">Thirst for Science</a>, and <a href="http://computationalbiologynews.blogspot.com/2007/09/review-approaches-towards-systems.html">Computational Biology News</a>. <a href="http://www.openhelix.com/blog/?p=82">SNPs are hot at Open Helix</a> and the <a href="http://spittoon.23andme.com/2008/01/31/snpwatchshuffling-snps-have-opposite-effect-in-men-and-women/">Spittoon</a>. Gopubmed.org is even hotter at <a href="http://blog.medical20.com/2008/01/gopubmed-interview-with-ceo.html">Medical 2.0</a>, <a href="http://konradscons.blogspot.com/2008/01/wikia-and-gopubmed-new-kids-on-search.html">Konrad's Konsiderations</a>, <a href="http://peanutbutter.wordpress.com/2008/01/06/gopubmed/">Peanut Butter</a>, <a href="http://nsaunders.wordpress.com/2008/01/07/gopubmed/">What You're Doing</a>, and <a href="http://mndoci.com/blog/2007/12/22/gopubmed-bringing-pubmed-and-the-semantic-web-together/">BBGM</a>. Pawel Szczesny became a <a href="http://freesci.wordpress.com/2008/01/08/freelancing-science-in-2008/">Freelance Scientist</a>, and posted <a href="http://freesci.wordpress.com/2008/01/24/visualization-of-internal-repeats-in-proteins-or-dna/">a novel method for visualising repeats</a> in sequences. Stew showed <a href="http://www.ghastlyfop.com/blog/2008/01/lamp-performance-for-dummies.html">how to increase MySQL speed</a>, and <a href="http://biocurious.com/anatomy-of-a-seminar">Biocurious</a> had a biohumorous article about the anatomy of a seminar. Last, but not least Perfect Storm <a href="http://tiago.org/ps/2008/01/23/a-holiday-ruby-and-scala/">compared Ruby with the new programming language Scala</a>.

That's it, I've done my civic duty for the year. I'm going home to sit my room with <a href="http://www.bioinformaticszen.com/2008/01/three-stories-about-science-and-the-web-the-movie/">a tin foil hat on</a>, <a href="http://www.bioinformaticszen.com/2008/01/world-of-bioinformatics-quest/">rolling 3d6</a>.
