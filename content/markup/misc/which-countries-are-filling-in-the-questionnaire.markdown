Thank you to everyone who has taken time to fill out the questionnaire, and especially to everyone who posted the questionnaire on their own blog or website. <a href="http://www.bioinformaticszen.com/2008/07/creating-a-picture-of-different-careers-in-bioinformatics/">You can still take part</a>, if you've got a spare 5 minutes and to try to give you a bit more encouragment, below are the top ten question answering countries so far.

Obviously, the most answers are coming from the USA. However there's not too much between the other countries, so if you can find ten people in your office to fill in the questionnaire you should push your country up the bioinformatics rankings. 

I'll post an update on the scores every week till the end of July.
