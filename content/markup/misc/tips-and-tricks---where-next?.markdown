The recent release of the bio::blogs <a href="http://www.bioinformaticszen.com/2007/06/bioblogs-11-special-edition/">"tips &amp; tricks" special</a> has proved popular and <a href="http://www.bioinformaticszen.com/2007/06/bioblogs-11-special-edition/#comments">comments</a> from three readers suggested continuing it further. But I'd like to know what kind of interest there would be in this. And how to carry it out.

One possibility is to aim for regular release cycles, for example every 4/6 months. Each issue would be on a specific topic, such as sequence analysis, network analysis, etc. This could be co-ordinated and set up on a wiki site.

Another idea I had is to set up a semantic wiki, the aim to create both a human and machine readable resource. This would be particularly useful for categorising the tools and databases available in bioinformatics.

These are just two examples, but I be really interested to hear your suggestions. Posting an idea here isn't a commitment, it could just be something you'd like to see. Like most amateur web ideas, it would probably just be me initially, and if it was useful, other people would naturally become interested in helping.

Of course the other suggestion is that this is just a successful one of a kind that should be left so.
