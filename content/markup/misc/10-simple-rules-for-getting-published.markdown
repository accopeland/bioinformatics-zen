A <a href="http://www.nodalpoint.org/2006/11/28/postdoc_hell">post</a> at Nodal point discusses a PLoS Computional Biology article on the problems of being a post doc. The post also contains another interesting PLoS reference - <a href="http://compbiol.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.0010057">10 simple rules for getting published</a>. The main points of the article are reading papers regularly, and being objective about research, especially your own.

<strong>UPDATE</strong> : There's also a discussion of this at <a href="http://biocurious.com/ten-simple-rules-for-getting-published">Biocurious</a>

I enjoy doing science most of the time, but I want to publish. I know that doing science just for the publications is not a good frame of mind to be in. However in the current system, itâ€™s how we are judged as scientists. Therefore, I would be worried about getting an academic position after my PhD without at least one publication, as a bare minimum.

With regard to the article, I try to read papers on a regular basis. However I think two a day is quite a large amount since it usually takes me a few hours to read the paper and add a mini review and key words to my <a href="http://jabref.sourceforge.net/">bibliographic database</a>. Plus the avalanche of publications falling into my computer from RSS feeds and email alerts makes keeping abreast of whatâ€™s going on in my field feel a daunting task. Thatâ€™s ignoring what is going on in biology in general.

As for being objective, my thoughts about my work range from â€œthis is rather rubbishâ€ to â€œmaybe I can publish thisâ€. Neither of which is very helpful, probably the best mentality to have is â€œWhat is the question I am trying to answer, and how does my work answer this?â€
