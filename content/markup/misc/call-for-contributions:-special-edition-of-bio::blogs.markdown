<a href="http://bioblogs.wordpress.com/">Bio::Blogs</a> is a monthly round up of what's being discussed on bioinformatics blogs.  In addition, to next month's edition at NodalPoint, there will also be a special edition here at Bioinformatics Zen. The aim, a community generated article of tips for computational biologists.

I hope that the text of the article will be generated by submissions from the bioinformatics community. That's means you reading this now. What would be your best piece of advice you would offer someone starting out in bioinformatics? Databases, coding, organisation?

Send your suggestions, with your website if you have one, to the <a href="mailto:mail@bioinformaticszen.com">Bioinformatics Zen email address</a>.   Everything will be compiled and posted with the next edition of Bio::Blogs, on June 1.
