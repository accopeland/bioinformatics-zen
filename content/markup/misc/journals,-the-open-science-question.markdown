I think journal policies towards preprint servers are covered by the data from the Romeo database, <a href="http://www.bioinformaticszen.com/2007/06/update-to-journal-preprint-policies/">outlined previously</a>. For the next stage of the open science edition of tips and tricks I think I need to include clarification of journal positions towards publication and discussion of data on blogs, wikis, and such like.

I spent a while trying to come up with a suitably clever letter, but this is the best I could do.
<blockquote>Dear Sirs,

I'm compiling, with the bioinformatics blogging community, a guide to open science. I believe one of the one of most important points on in this issue are journal editorial polices towards sharing and discussing research, prior to publication. The use of preprint servers is becoming accepted, however the position of journals towards the use of blogs and wikis to discuss results is less clear.

I am writing to ask for your policy regarding this. I would like to permission to include your reply in the finished guide. You can find wiki page for this at wiki.nodalpoint.org/open_science.</blockquote>
As you might expect, I've put this on a <a href="http://wiki.nodalpoint.org/open_science_information_request">nodal point wiki page</a>. If you've got any corrections or suggestions, you can leave them here in the comments or edit the letter yourself. I'll load up them into the SPAM bot and send them out on Friday.
