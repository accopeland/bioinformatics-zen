Scratching my head trying to think of something interesting to write about bioinformatics, usually I just stare into the middle distance instead. This is what I do most weekend in the Starbucks near my flat.

Starting a blog on bioinformatics seemed like a good idea at the time, I liked reading other people's, so why not start my own. However writing a blog takes more of my time than I thought it would, and the number of posts I write has slipped from two a week, to two a month. My motivation decreases as the amount of work, and therefore stress, in my PhD increases. What keeps me writing is a mixture of pride, the vain hope that one day I might be invited to SciFoo, and perhaps having a blog might help me get a job after I graduate. Of course, an interest in the ever changing field of bioinformatics is useful too.

But anyway, if you're still reading this, and not buying cheap herbal Viagra, then I'd like to think that this blog is my contribution to best practices in bioinformatics. The field is after all a new one, thirty years perhaps, so there's still plenty of milling about going on.
