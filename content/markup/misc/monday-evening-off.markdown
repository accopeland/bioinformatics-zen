No post this Monday as I spent Friday evening writing Bio::Blogs. However Shirley Wu has asked me to the mention the PSB session proposal. If you'd like to get involved in the Open Notebook Science movement, this is a good place to begin. <a href="http://onebiglab.blogspot.com/2008/01/call-for-letters-of-support-for-psb.html">Shirley's post outlines the requirements</a> and <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dv4t5rx_33fpxx9pw5">there's a Google Doc</a> for the proposal itself.
