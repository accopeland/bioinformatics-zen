title: Decomplected bioinformatics experiments

  REFLECTION:
    - seem obivious to many people
    - Java, Ant, XML, MySQL
    - Ruby, ORM/ActiveRecord, Rake, YAML
    - Clojure/Lisp, flatfiles, Make, coreutils,
    - change in attitude, think I know everything =>  realise I know very little
    - Still use databases where appropriate - tokyocabinent generates single
      file.
