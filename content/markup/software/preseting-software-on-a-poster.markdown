  title: Presenting software on a poster

I've spent time recently working on [a tool to simplify genome
scaffolding][post]. I presented a poster on this at this year's American
Society for Microbiology conference (ASM 2011). I find poster sessions at large
conferences can be overwhelming. There are many posters and it can be hard to
find the most relevant.

Similarly, from the opposite side, being overlooked in a room with hundreds of
other posters can be disheartening. I think creating and presenting a poster
about software can be hard too. Software is an abstract concept so it's
difficult to relay a narrative that poster viewers can connect with. Contrast
this with presenting research which benefits from a research storyline and,
possibly, eye-catching figures.

The poster I choose to create for ASM minimised the amount text on the page.
There is [written documentation on Scaffolder][scaf] in the form of Ruby Doc,
Unix man pages and a getting started guide so repeating this on the poster felt
redundant. I also believed that large amounts of text describing software would
be forgotten. I designed the poster as an a brief introduction to the software.
Anyone interested in learning more could follow the short URL
([http://next.gs][scaf]) website containing more details.

The left-hand side of the poster describes the problem of creating a genome by
joining the contigs manually. The larger right-hand side illustrates the
scaffolder file format and how my software solves these problems. If any one
expressed an interest in learning more I ran through a two-minute talk using
the poster as a prop. I could then answer any additional questions. I think
this worked well as I was able to have several conversations about problems
people were having with their own genome projects.

The poster was simple to produce and took about one week. I created the poster
in Inkscape and the design is composed mainly of simple shapes and text. When
I couldn't produce any part of my envisaged design a Google search found plenty
of Inkscape tutorials. Overall I felt that an information light, but visually
appealing, design was the good way to attract interest in the software and
start a conversation.
