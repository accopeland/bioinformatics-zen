  title: Presenting bioinformatics software as a poster

I recently presented a [genome scaffolding tool][scaf] at this year's American
Society for Microbiology conference (ASM 2011). I find poster sessions
difficult at times. It's hard to know if you're making the most of your time at
large conference with so many posters to look at.

I also think designing a poster to present software is difficult too. Software
is an abstract concept so I think it's hard to present this in a meaningful
way. Contrast this to presenting research where there is often the benefit of
a research storyline and figures to present. Here is the poster is used at ASM
2011 to present my scaffolding software.

The poster is light on details. The URL for the documentation is however
prominently displayed as the second largest font size after the title. I think
a text-heavy poster for software could be a little overwhelming to read. This
was particulary in mind where the conference was predomiantly wet-laboratory
reserach focused.

The basic outline of the poster is, I hope, easy to follow. The left-hand side
describes the problem result from manually joining and building a genome
scaffold. The larger right-hand side illustrates the scaffolder file format and
how it solves these problems. When people expressed an interest I was able to
run through the main points of the poster and answer any questions they had.

I have no graphical design experience. The poster design consists of the common
shapes and text in Inkscape arranged in what I thought was most aesthetically
pleasing. The only part that differs from this is the grunge background on the
left-side which was just an image set as the background.
