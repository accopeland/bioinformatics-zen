Every year, Manchester University Faculty of Life Sciences organises a symposia
to highlight the work that has been produced by the department. Third year PhD
students have to produce a poster, as part of the Faculty’s graduate training
program, and to encourage students to display and discuss their work. My poster
is finished, and I’ve put it here for anyone who’s interested.
