This is a ten presentation I gave at the Society for Molecular Biology and
Evolution in conference in 2008. This describes part of my PhD in the [Bergman
Lab][bergman] at the University of Manchester. Part of this work was published
as the article ['Evolutionary Systems Biology of Amino Acid Biosynthetic Cost
in Yeast'][article].
