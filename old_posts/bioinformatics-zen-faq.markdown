I guess one of the golden rules of blogging is write about what people are interested in. Here's the most common questions I get emailed, and my answers to them.

<strong>Can you give me a Bioinformatics PhD studentship? Can you find me a Bioinformatics PhD?</strong>
Sorry, no. I'm a PhD student myself and so I have neither the position, experience, or money to offer you one. I'm sorry but I also can't arrange a PhD for you. I'm more than happy to answer any emails when someone takes the time to write a thoughtful correspondence, but I'm not a bioinformatics careers service.

<strong>How can I find a PhD?</strong>
I can only give my opinion, but I think one universal piece of advice is to take a little time when applying to supervisors rather than spamming every bioinformatics researcher you can find. When I say spamming I mean writing a generic cover letter and CV, then sending these to everyone with a webpage in the hope that you get lucky. I think this is bad because in the first instance supervisors know when someone has sent them a CV on the off-chance of an offer. Secondly, do you want to spend three failure-littered years working on something you're not really interested in?

A better approach, after you've found all the projects you can, spend some time reading the descriptions, narrow the list down to the ones that really excite you. Read the last 2-3 papers that the supervisor wrote, and if you still want to do the PhD, write to the PI telling them what excites you about their research. <del>Even better pick up the phone and give them a call.</del> You could also email the supervisor, and ask if you can phone to talk about the project further. If you come across as a bright young researcher with a lot to offer, you'll definitely get their interest.

<strong>Should I do a Master's degree in Bioinformatics?</strong>
This depends on how you feel, but for me I'm glad I did a Masters. A year long course gave me a chance to learn programming, statistics and other bioinformatics foundations. The 4-6 month research project also gave me an idea of whether or not I wanted to do a PhD. Of course plenty of researchers are very successful in bioinformatics without ever having done a masters. Whatever your decision, do a Masters or go straight into PhD, I really recommend spending some time to learn programming before hand. If you're not already familiar. Doing an evening class or getting a good text book and practising at home will really help when you start on your research project.

<strong>Which programming language should I use?</strong>
A simple answer would be Python. This language has become more and more popular in bioinformatics, and so will have an increasing biolibrary base, as well as a growing Python bioinformatics community. I use Ruby, so it's hard for me to write this, but I've heard that Python is also one of the easiest and simple programming languages to learn. What makes a language simple and easy? Well it reduces the options for the programmer to create bugs, and makes the code easier to understand. However, as I said, that was the simple answer. For instance, if you are about to start a Master's degree, it would be a better idea to learn the language taught on the course. Another consideration is the language used by your colleages, if you start using Python but everyone else is using Perl, then there'll be little opportunity to get help or advice.

As far as I have seen, there are four main languages used in bioinformatics. Java and Perl are by far the most widely used, and this will most likely be the case for the foreseeable future, as most Masters courses are teaching these. Perl has a huge set of libraries for bioinformatics, and Java is popular for building applications with graphical user interfaces. Ruby and Python are getting attention because, as I mentioned, they are good for producing code that is easy to write, and easy to read which is great for programmer. There's also R which is great for statistics, but I wouldn't use it for everyday scripting.

So here's my answers to the most common questions I get asked, if you've got a different opinion or something to add, please let me know in the comments.
