In this video I'm showing how a spread sheet of amino acid data can be
converted to [comma separated value (CSV) format][csv]. The amino acid data is
then searched using [grep][grep] to find for the entry for cysteine. [AWK][awk]
is used to sort by carbon content. Finally I use the [R language][R] to create
histograms and x/y plots of the data.
